# 01-HTML-Git-CSS-code-refactor

## The purpose of this project is to showcase how to take a client's pre-existing code and refactor it. Refactor means to restructure the source code and improve its operation without altering its functionality. In this project, I will be replacing non-semantic elements with semantic elements to provide a meaningful purpose behind different pieces of the code. I will also give this source code more accessibility. What I mean by accessibility is to provide people with disabilities better access to the website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Giving websites accessibility is good for businesses because they rank higher in search engines such as Google and Bing. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which could be due to people with disabilities being unable to access their website. I will also clean this code up and make it more efficient for other web developers by condensing the CSS rule sets with repetitive properties and values down into fewer CSS rule sets. This CSS style sheet and HTML document will also be reorganized in a way where the code will align much better than the original source code. This project will give other developers an example on how to take a client's source code and improve its efficiency and presentation for long-term use.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a demonstration of what the finished web application's presentation and functionality will imitate:
